App builded using React.js, Charkra-UI and  React-Router to navigate or filter and narrow the search of round trip flights from a JSON file. The data was getted (fetched) by   mocking a server, and showed in differetes pages with several cities (origin) and alternatives destination. The app allow to navigate between pages through differentes links that allow you to choose your fligth on basis of number of passengers and price.
