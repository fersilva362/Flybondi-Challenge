# [Flybondi-Challenge](https://648da97abb4a66023e46af0d--gregarious-squirrel-c9c8ac.netlify.app/)
In this ocasion I would like to show you an app which is a mimetic of Flybondi' site and was part of a challenge proposed by #GonzaloPozzo. The app was builded using #ReactJS and #CharkraUI that allow you navigate, filter and narrow the search of round trip flights. The data was getted (fetched) by mocking a server, and the app showed it in differents pages containing cities (origin) and alternatives destination. The app allows  navigating between pages and  choosing your fligth on basis of number of passengers and price. I hope that you enjoy it!!
 
## Below, I show some screen print of app.
